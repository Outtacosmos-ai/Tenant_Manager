## 1. Project Overview

DentiaPro is a back-end SaaS platform for dental clinic management. It provides a robust API for managing appointments, patients, billing, and inventory across multiple dental clinics using a multi-tenant architecture.

### Objectives
- Develop a scalable, multi-tenant backend system
- Implement secure authentication and authorization
- Create RESTful APIs for core dental clinic operations
- Integrate with payment and communication services
- Establish comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for efficient deployment

### Technology Stack
- Django & Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL (with django-tenants for multi-tenancy)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Jenkins (CI/CD)
- Nginx (Web Server)
- Prometheus, Grafana, and Sentry (Monitoring & Logging)

## 2. Architecture

DentiaPro uses a multi-tenant architecture where each dental clinic is a separate tenant with its own schema in the PostgreSQL database.
